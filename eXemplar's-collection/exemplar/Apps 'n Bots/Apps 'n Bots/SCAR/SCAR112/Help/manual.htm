<p align="left"><b><font size="2">Introduction<br>
</font></b>There used to be a cheat for THE GAME which was able to do virtually every
boring action the players do every day over and over again. The name was
AutoRune. It worked on almost all Windows systems and introduced scriptable
cheats for the game, it could do anything except auto-PKing. The problem however
was, that THE COMPANY could easily make it cease to work by changing the game
communication protocol, which they did. Now the AutoRune and other bots, like
RS are useless and dead. AutoRune due to communication protocol change,
RS due to making the JAVA code undecompilable or at least much harder to
decompile. So people have to get their old clickers out of the shelves, clean
dust off them and cheat as much as they can, which is not very much, but at least
something.<br>
My ultimate goal was to make the best clicker for the game, however I realized
fast, that there could be no &quot;best&quot; as some people prefer functionality but
others ease to use. So I decided to design a CDE for the game, something that
has never been tried before. CDE stands for cheat development environment. SCAR
stands for Shite Compared to AutoRune. It's not just a clicker, it's a
programmable clicker using Pascal language and I'm also planning to add
possibility to compile the scripts to exe files, so anyone with basic Pascal and
SCAR knowledge can create their own fully functional cheats. Do it while you
can, color macros is not the future of THE GAME, I have my own reasons to
believe in it, I will however keep them with myself.<br>
I won't go deep into explanation of Pascal language, there are plenty tutorials
out there, use <a href="http://www.google.com">www.google.com</a> but I will
demonstrate some basic control structures and compare some of them to AutoRune script.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Introduction II<br>
</b>Lots of time has passed since the very first SCAR version. It's been 
improved a lot. I've been threatened by THE COMPANY because of it, it has caused 
lots of frustration and confusion because of the complexity of it's usage and 
surprisingly there are some people who have actually enjoyed it. There 
have been some Anti-SCAR things added to The Game like Minimap, which changes 
angle every time you look at it to disable map walking scripts and fatigue with 
sleepwords. <br>
The SCAR is used by about six hundreds of players daily when I write 
these lines. There is SCAR forum, there are few script dumps. And sadly there 
are scammers impersonating me. You must believe I will never distribute any 
files by e-mail or likewise. We never implemented ability to compile scripts not because we 
couldn't, but because Cow, former community leader, convinced me, that this 
might get abused by scammers. It's a big problem. The Company should fight 
scammers not cheaters.<br>
So what's the future of SCAR? I'm not going to add anything new to it, I might 
keep fixing bugs, but the further development is now in Dylock's hands. He's 
working on SCAR that is compatible with version 2 of The Game.</p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="2">General<br>
</font></b>You should start with trying out sample scripts. The shortcut keys
are Ctrl+Alt+R to run script and Ctrl+Alt+S to stop.<br>
If it doesn't click for some reason or you are using SUN JAVA VM, turn off
silent mouse from Tools menu.<br>
If it can't find the client window, select Specify Client title from Tools menu
and enter the title of the client you are using. Character case does matter. Or 
just drag the crosshair over the client (the game area itself).<br>
If it can't handle the map (map failed), make sure you have turned it correctly
(the north should be pointing perfectly up and the cross should be perfectly
straight). Most map walking scripts won't work because of the Anti-SCAR routines 
mentioned above.<br>
If it can't read texts or there are any other problems, make sure you have
extracted all required files and directories from the archive.</p>
<p align="left"><b><font size="2">Pascal basics<br>
</font></b>Some Pascal basics can be found here, but I must warn you that the site will
scare you: <a href="http://www2.iicm.edu/hmcard/courseware/pascal/Pascal2.htm">
http://www2.iicm.edu/hmcard/courseware/pascal/Pascal2.htm</a><br>

http://web.mit.edu/taoyue/www/tutorials/pascal/contents.html</a><br>
You really should find and read a serious Pascal tutorial, this manual will give you an
idea, not teach the Pascal language.<br>
The simplest Pascal program:<br>
<font face="Lucida Console" size="2">begin<br>
end.<br>
</font>As you see, it requires 2 lines - begin shows where the program starts, end with
dot - where it ends. Everything after it gets ignored. A better program would
be:</p>
<div style="border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1; padding-left: 4">
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<font face="Lucida Console" size="2">program MyFirst;<br>
begin<br>
&nbsp; Writeln ('Hello World!');<br>
end.</font></p>
</div>
<p align="left">It's a good style to specify program name at the beginning, also pay attention
to spacing, small and capital letters, usage of semicolons.<br>
Here is a thing about variables. I know most of you avoided them at all in AR
script, but they are easier here (I hope). The variables have types. SCAR
supports less types than Pascal and for those who are familiar with Pascal - it
doesn't support arrays (ok it actually does, I just didn't want to explain it
here :P). Here are types you will use:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber1">
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">string</td>
    <td width="33%">Text, string of characters</td>
    <td width="34%">'a', 'some text', 'awaa'#13'bah'</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">Integer</td>
    <td width="33%">Whole numbers, positive and negative</td>
    <td width="34%">0, 1, 2, 3, ..., -1, -2, -3, ...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">Extended</td>
    <td width="33%">Real numbers, positive and negative</td>
    <td width="34%">0, 1.5, -100.67, 100.3333</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">Boolean</td>
    <td width="33%">Have only 2 values - true or false</td>
    <td width="34%">True, False</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p align="left">There are other types too, but these are the main to operate with. A simple
example:</p>
<div style="border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1; padding-left: 4">
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">
<font face="Lucida Console" size="2">program VarDemo;<br>
var s: string;<br>
begin<br>
&nbsp; s:= 'Hello World!';<br>
&nbsp; Writeln(s);<br>
end.</font></p>
</div>
<p align="left">As you see, we have to use var variable_name : type; to define the variable
before using it.<br>
You will sometimes want to print out Integer and Extended type variable values,
so here is a sample to do it as only strings can be printed out. A sample of
type conversion:</p>
<div style="border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1; padding-left: 4">
<p align="left"><font face="Lucida Console" size="2">program PrintNumbers;<br>
var i: Integer;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
e: Extended;<br>
begin<br>
&nbsp;
i:= 10;<br>
&nbsp;
e:= 3.5;<br>
&nbsp;
Writeln('i=' + IntToStr(i) + ', e=' + FloatToStr(e));<br>
end.</font></p>
</div>
<p align="left">(Copy and paste it in SCAR window to test)<br>
What can you do with variables? It depends on variable type. You can concatenate
string variables: s:= 'wo' + 'rd'; will result with 'word' in variable s. You
can do a whole bunch of arithmetic operations with Integer and Extended: i:= 4 +
5 will result with 9 in i etc. Boolean are useful too. You can set it to true or
false: b:= True; or to logical condition b:= (a = 1); will result with True in b
is a is equal to 1 or False if a is equal to anything else.<br>
Now about control types. I will use AR script to compare.<br>
<i>Conditional statement</i>.</p>
<div style="border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1; padding-left: 4">
<p align="left"><font face="Lucida Console" size="2">&nbsp; if( a = 1)or(a = 4)then<br>
&nbsp; begin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a:= 0;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Writeln('a was 1 or 4 so we made it to zero');<br>
&nbsp; end else<br>
&nbsp; begin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Writeln('a was neither 1 nor 4');<br>
&nbsp; end;</font></p>
</div>
<p align="left">This script checks if variable a is 1 or 4 and acts accordingly. Here is
AutoRune equivalent for ARscripters:</p>
<div style="border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 1; padding-left: 4">

<p align="left"><b><font size="2">Creating map walking<br>
</font></b>
<u><i>
<b>Landmarks don't work with the regular RS client anymore</b></i></u><br>
This section explains how to create map walking scripts. The
functions/procedures that you will have to use are: CreateLandmark, CreatePath,
AddLandmarkToPath, ProcessMap, ProcessPath.<br>
How does it work? First thing to do is to create landmarks all along the path.
To do it, open the minimap (compass arrows have to make a perfect, straight
cross) and press &quot;Create Landmark&quot;. If everything is correct, a copy of minimap
should appear with all objects, walls etc in it. Cut out the area you want to
create the landmark of. I prefer landmarks in width and height 25% of minimap's
width and height and smaller. Then press ok. It should generate CreateLandmark
command for you. Do it all along the path, make sure every next landmark is
perfectly visible from the previous one. They can't be too close. After you have
done that, you will have a list of them. Assign them to variables (like in
sample scripts).<br>
Next thing you do is creating the path. Create new path with CreatePath like in
sample scripts.<br>
Now you need to add the landmarks to the path. The sequence is important - the
destination landmark comes first, then the one right before it etc, the last one
is the place you start at. Let's say we have AddLandmarkToPath(BedPath,
LandMark4, 5, -4); What do the numbers mean? BedPath is path variable, LandMark4
is landmark variable, 5, -4 are coordinates - x, y. x, y represents relative
coordinates from the landmark that should be clicked to move along the path. In
this example SCAR will click 5 squares to right from the landmark's left side
and 4 squares above the landmark's upper edge.<br>
Now that the paths are created, we need to move by them somehow. I propose to
use this procedure:<br>
<font face="Lucida Console">procedure GoByPath(path: Integer);<br>
var<br>
&nbsp; HowFar: Integer;<br>
&nbsp; x, y: Integer;<br>
&nbsp; r: Extended;<br>
&nbsp; Dest: Boolean;<br>
begin<br>
&nbsp; repeat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MoveMouse(460,15);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait(200);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ProcessMap;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HowFar:= ProcessPath(Path, x, y, r, 0.1);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Status('HowFar='+IntToStr(HowFar)+' x='+IntToStr(x) + ' y='+IntToStr(y)+'
r='+FloatToStr(r));<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(r &gt; 0.6)then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; begin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(HowFar = 0)then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ClickMap(x, y, True)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ClickMap(x + Random(3)-1, y +
Random(3) - 1, True);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dest:= (HowFar=0)and(x&lt;=19)and(x&gt;=17)and(y&lt;=19)and(y&gt;=17);<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(not Dest)then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait(5000);<br>
&nbsp; until(Dest);<br>
end;<br>
</font>If you want to know how ProcessPath works, keep reading. It has 5
parameters ProcessPath(Path, x, y, r, tolerance); Path is path variable, x, y
are variables where coordinates to be clicked are returned, r returns
possibility that we are still on the path (0..1), where 0 means that we are
totally lost (or map is closed or turned to wrong angle) and 1 means it's a
perfect match. tolerance contains allowed error. Like, if you are near landmark
l2 and you see landmark l1 which is your destination, it will go to l1 whenever
match of that landmark + tolerance =&gt; match of the current landmark. I suggest
to use 0.1 or 0.2 as tolerance. If you are required to use bigger then your
landmarks are somehow bad.</p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>Using forms.<br>
</b>To use forms you got to understand how objects work. First of all, what is a 
class? Class is basically a definition of object with it's properties and 
methods, it's like a blueprint. When we create object from class, we have 
something to actually work with. So we have to create everything - forms, 
textboxes, buttons, checkboxes etc. After you have finished using the object, 
free it.<br>
Here is a sample form:<br>
</font><font face="Lucida Console">program FormTest;<br>
var<br>
&nbsp; form, self: TForm;<br>
&nbsp; Application: TApplication;<br>
&nbsp; UserLabel, PassLabel: TLabel;<br>
&nbsp; txtUser, txtPass: TEdit;<br>
&nbsp; ButtonOK: TButton;<br>
<br>
//Event handler for ButtonOk.OnClick<br>
procedure buttonclick(sender: TObject);<br>
begin<br>
&nbsp; Application.MessageBox('You pressed the button!', 'Button Pressed', 0);<br>
end;<br>
<br>
<br>
begin<br>
&nbsp; //Initialize Application object<br>
&nbsp; Application:= GetApplication;<br>
&nbsp; Self:= GetSelf;<br>
&nbsp; //////////////////////////////////////<br>
&nbsp; // Creating and using forms<br>
&nbsp; //////////////////////////////////////<br>
&nbsp; //Create form for login/password<br>
&nbsp; Form:= TForm.Create(nil);<br>
&nbsp; Form.Width := 220;<br>
&nbsp; Form.Height := 140;<br>
&nbsp; Form.Position := poScreenCenter;<br>
&nbsp; Form.BorderStyle := bsDialog;<br>
&nbsp; Form.Caption := 'Hello There';<br>
<br>
&nbsp; //Create things on form<br>
&nbsp; UserLabel := TLabel.Create(Form);<br>
&nbsp; UserLabel.Top := 12;<br>
&nbsp; UserLabel.Left := 16;<br>
&nbsp; UserLabel.Caption := 'Username:';<br>
&nbsp; UserLabel.Parent := Form;<br>
&nbsp; PassLabel := TLabel.Create(Form);<br>
&nbsp; PassLabel.Top := 42;<br>
&nbsp; PassLabel.Left := 16;<br>
&nbsp; PassLabel.Caption := 'Password:';<br>
&nbsp; PassLabel.Parent := Form;<br>
&nbsp; txtUser := TEdit.Create(Form);<br>
&nbsp; txtUser.Top := 10;<br>
&nbsp; txtUser.Left := 86;<br>
&nbsp; txtUser.Width := 100;<br>
&nbsp; txtUser.Parent := Form;<br>
&nbsp; txtPass := TEdit.Create(Form);<br>
&nbsp; txtPass.Top := 40;<br>
&nbsp; txtPass.Left := 86;<br>
&nbsp; txtPass.Width := 100;<br>
&nbsp; txtPass.PasswordChar:= '*';<br>
&nbsp; txtPass.Parent := Form;<br>
&nbsp; ButtonOK := TButton.Create(Form);<br>
&nbsp; ButtonOK.Left := 60;<br>
&nbsp; ButtonOK.Top := 80;<br>
&nbsp; ButtonOK.Width := 80;<br>

&nbsp; //Show modal form<br>
&nbsp; Form.ShowModal;<br>
&nbsp; Form.Free;<br>
end.</font><font size="2"><b><br>
</b>
</font><br>
Let's look at bits of the code.<br>
<font face="Lucida Console">&nbsp; Application:= GetApplication; - get reference 
to SCAR application.<br>
&nbsp; Self:= GetSelf; - get reference to main form of SCAR.<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; Form:= TForm.Create(nil); - create a new form.<br>
&nbsp; after form is created, we can set various properties of it, like:<br>
&nbsp; Form.Height := 140;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp; To create controls on form, create a new object like this:<br>
&nbsp; UserLabel := TLabel.Create(Form);<br>
&nbsp; And then specify the new form as parent of the just created control:<br>
&nbsp; UserLabel.Parent := Form;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; You can assign events to controls like this:<br>
&nbsp; ButtonOK.OnClick := @buttonclick;<br>
&nbsp; That means every time button is clicked, procedure buttonclick will be 
called.<br>
&nbsp; Here is how you define the event handler procedure for onClick.<br>
&nbsp; procedure buttonclick(sender: TObject);<br>
&nbsp; begin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... code here<br>
&nbsp; end;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Form.ShowModal; - form will be shown and script will wait until it's 
closed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp; Form.Free; - form is destroyed to free the memory. All controls on form 
are destroyed as well.</font></p>
